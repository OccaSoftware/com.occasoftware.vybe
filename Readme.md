## Branching

The default branch is main. That's where you can find the latest version of the package. For each release version, we create a new branch titled release/<semver>. No changes are made to those branches. They exist for reference only.

During development, we merge PRs directly on the main branch (or maintenance branch, if applicable). The main branch and any release branches should always be shippable: the code compiles and features are complete.
